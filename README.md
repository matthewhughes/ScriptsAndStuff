ScriptsAndStuff
===============

A bunch of scripts and config files that I find particularly useful. Stored on Github for posterity, and in case I need to rebuild my machine. 

Screen.SH

My Lenovo G580 often struggles to acceptably mirror on one of the screens on work. This little script manually sets the screen resolution. 

.bashrc 

My Bash profile. It shows what Git branch I'm in, and all that cool stuff.
